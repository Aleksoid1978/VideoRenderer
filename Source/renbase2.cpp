// Send a message to indicate what our supplier should do about quality.

// Tf1 is the due time for F1
// T1 is the time at that point (NOW!)
// Tr1 is the time that f1 WILL actually be rendered
// L1 is the latency of the graph for frame F1 = Tr1-T1
// D1 (for delay) is how late F1 will be beyond its due time i.e.
// D1 = (Tr1-Tf1) which is what the supplier really wants to know.
// Unfortunately Tr1 is in the future and is unknown, so is L1
//
// We could estimate L1 by its value for a previous frame,
// L0 = Tr0-T0 and work off
// D1' = ((T1+L0)-Tf1) = (T1 + (Tr0-T0) -Tf1)
// Rearranging terms:
// D1' = (T1-T0) + (Tr0-Tf1)
//       adding (Tf0-Tf0) and rearranging again:
//     = (T1-T0) + (Tr0-Tf0) + (Tf0-Tf1)
//     = (T1-T0) - (Tf1-Tf0) + (Tr0-Tf0)
// But (Tr0-Tf0) is just D0 - how late frame zero was, and this is the
// Late field in the quality message that we send.
// The other two terms just state what correction should be applied before
// using the lateness of F0 to predict the lateness of F1.
// (T1-T0) says how much time has actually passed (we have lost this much)
// (Tf1-Tf0) says how much time should have passed if we were keeping pace
// (we have gained this much).
//
// Suppliers should therefore work off:
//    Quality.Late + (T1-T0)  - (Tf1-Tf0)
// and see if this is "acceptably late" or even early (i.e. negative).
// They get T1 and T0 by polling the clock, they get Tf1 and Tf0 from
// the time stamps in the frames.  They get Quality.Late from us.
